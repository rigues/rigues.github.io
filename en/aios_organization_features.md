# AIOS Platform Organization and Features

## AIOS Platform Basic Structure
The basic structure of AIOS can be divided into four modules, as illustrated by the figure below:

| Module | Function | 
| :---|:---| 
| **Acquisition** | Data capture, using cameras (IP or analog connected via DVR) to obtain information about the location or situation to be monitored. |
| **Processing** | Local execution of AI algorithms and sending the results to the platform. | 
| **Control** | Control of peripherals (via PLCs, Programmable Logic Controllers) and other systems (via APIs), based on the detection results produced by the algorithms. | 
| **Management and Presentation** | Creation and management of pipelines and devices, analysis of metadata generated by the AIBox, production of dashboards and reports for presenting the results. | 

## Key Features of the AIOS Platform
* **No-code interface**: allows the creation of AI solutions without the need for programming.
* **Dozens of ready-to-use components**: including people and object detection, event counting, ALPR, communication with external devices via PLCs or GPIO, notification on various platforms, and many more. 
* **Utilizes existing IP cameras**: transforms your existing cameras into versatile smart cameras at a fraction of the cost of dedicated hardware.
* **Local execution (on the AIBox) of algorithms**: ensures low latency in event detection.
* **Enhanced privacy and reduced bandwidth consumption**: only the metadata resulting from processing is sent to the platform, reducing the risk of exposure of sensitive data (images captured by your cameras) and bandwidth consumption compared to cloud-processing solutions.
* **Customizable Dashboards**: organize pages, components, counters, and graphs according to your needs. Dashboards can be shared online, with public visibility or password-controlled access.
* **API for integration**: integrate AIOS with existing solutions and tools, or develop custom solutions that require advanced processing.
* **Training module (Dojo)**: allows the development and training of customized AI models, perfectly adapted to your needs.
* **Device fleet management**: see which devices are part of your fleet, which pipelines are available or running, system resource usage, and more.
* **Platform developed in Brazil**: suitable for the needs of the national market and with technical support in Portuguese.
