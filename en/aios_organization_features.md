# AIOS Platform Organization and Resources

## Basic Structure of the AIOS Platform
The basic structure of AIOS can be divided into four modules, as illustrated in the figure below:

| Module | Function | 
|:---|:---| 
| **Acquisition** | Data capture, using cameras (IP or analog connected via DVR) to obtain information about the location or situation to be monitored. |
| **Processing** | Local execution of AI algorithms and sending the results to the platform. | 
| **Control** | Control of peripherals (through PLCs, Programmable Logic Controllers) and other systems (via APIs), based on the detection results produced by the algorithms. | 
| **Management and Presentation** | Creation and management of pipelines and devices, analysis of metadata generated by the AIBox, production of dashboards and reports for result presentation. | 

## Main Features of the AIOS Platform
* **No-code interface**: allows the creation of AI solutions without the need for programming.
* **Dozens of ready-to-use components**: including people and object detection, event counting, ALPR, communication with external devices via PLCs or GPIO, notification across various platforms, and many more.
* **Utilizes existing IP cameras**: transforms the cameras you already have into versatile smart cameras at a fraction of the cost of dedicated hardware.
* **Local execution (on the AIBox) of algorithms**: ensures low latency in event detection.
* **Greater privacy and lower bandwidth consumption**: only the metadata resulting from the processing is sent to the platform, reducing the risk of exposing sensitive data (images captured by your cameras) and bandwidth consumption compared to solutions that perform processing in the cloud.
* **Customizable dashboards**: organize pages, components, counters, and charts according to your needs. Dashboards can be shared on the internet, with public visibility or password-protected access control.
* **API for integration**: integrate AIOS with existing solutions and tools, or develop custom solutions that require advanced processing.
* **Training module (Dojo)**: allows the development and training of custom AI models, perfectly adapted to your needs.
* **Device fleet management**: see which devices are part of your fleet, which pipelines are available or running, system resource usage, and more.
* **Platform developed in Brazil**: suited to the needs of the national market and with technical support in Portuguese.
