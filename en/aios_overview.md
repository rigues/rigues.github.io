# AIOS Platform Overview

Developed by dtLabs, AIOS is a platform that combines hardware and software, enabling the quick and easy deployment of artificial intelligence and computer vision solutions applicable to various market segments, such as industry, logistics, agribusiness, retail, occupational safety, asset protection, urbanism, and much more.

It is composed of specialized hardware, called *AIBox*, combined with software featuring a flexible no-code interface, which aggregates ready-to-use computer vision models, tools for training and managing custom models, and resources for managing devices connected to the platform.

Far from being just another tool, AIOS is an ecosystem that puts the power of Artificial Intelligence directly into the hands of users, regardless of their programming experience.
