# AIOS Platform Overview

Developed by dtLabs, AIOS is a platform that combines hardware and software, enabling the quick and easy deployment of artificial intelligence and computer vision solutions that can be applied to various market segments, such as industry, logistics, agribusiness, retail, occupational safety, asset protection, urban planning, and much more.

It consists of specialized hardware, called *AIBox*, combined with software featuring a flexible no-code interface, which includes ready-to-use computer vision models, tools for training and managing customized models, and features for managing devices connected to the platform.

Far from being just another tool, AIOS is an ecosystem that puts the power of Artificial Intelligence directly into the hands of users, regardless of their programming experience.
