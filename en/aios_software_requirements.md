# AIOS Platform Software Requirements

To use AIOS, all you need is a supported web browser (Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge) and a personal computer with internet access. We recommend using a monitor with a resolution of 1,280 x 720 pixels or higher. Note that the AIOS interface **does not** support mobile devices.
